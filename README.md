## üîß Recent Fixes

### Site URL Configuration (September 2025)
- **URL Standardization**: Standardized WordPress site URL to lowercase `https://zakspov.com` following best practices
- **Database Update**: Modified `wp_options` table to set both `siteurl` and `home` options to standardized URL
- **Documentation Update**: Updated README.md and .cursorrules to reflect correct URL structure
- **Configuration**: 
  - Live Site: `https://zakspov.com` (production site)
  - Test Site: `https://zakspov.com` (development data only)
- **Impact**: All WordPress-generated URLs now use the standardized lowercase domain structure

**Files Modified:**
- Database: `wp_options` table (`siteurl` and `home` options)
- `README.md` - Updated all URL references
- `.cursorrules` - Updated project configuration

### Age Verification Modal (September 2025)
- **SEO-Compliant Implementation**: Modal positioned in footer to avoid H3 interference with main content H1s
- **localStorage Persistence**: Users only see the modal once per browser session
- **Dynamic Styling**: Uses theme accent colors with automatic text color contrast
- **Accessibility Features**: Keyboard navigation support (ESC to exit, Enter to confirm)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layout with proper touch targets
- **Custom Logo Integration**: Automatically displays site logo or falls back to site title
- **Configurable Exit URL**: Admin can set custom exit URL in FlexPress Settings ‚Üí General
- **Legal Compliance**: Includes required age verification text for adult content sites

**Files Added:**
- `assets/css/age-verification.css` - Modal styling with accent color theming
- `assets/js/age-verification.js` - Modal functionality and localStorage management
- Modal HTML integrated into `footer.php` for SEO compliance

**Usage:**
- Modal appears automatically on first visit
- Users can reset verification status via browser console: `flexpressAgeVerification.reset()`
- Check verification status: `flexpressAgeVerification.status()`
- Configure exit URL in WordPress Admin ‚Üí FlexPress Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí "Age Verification Exit URL"

### Join Page Continue Button (September 2025)
- **Issue**: Continue button on join page was not responding to clicks
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript selector mismatch (`join-continue-btn` vs `membership-continue-btn`)
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed JavaScript selector to match button ID
  - Implemented registration functionality using existing `flexpress_process_registration_and_payment` AJAX handler
  - Implemented login functionality using existing `flexpress_ajax_login` AJAX handler
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Updated WordPress site URL to localhost:8085 for development testing (reverted back to zakspov.com for production)
- **Result**: Continue button now properly processes user registration/login and redirects to payment page

### Payment Success Login Flow (September 2025)
- **Issue**: Users redirected to `/payment-success/` after payment were not logged in, causing redirect to login page
- **Root Cause**: Payment-success page lacked login check and auto-login capability
- **Solution**: 
  - Added login check to payment-success page with auto-login for valid user_id parameters
  - Updated JavaScript redirects in flowguard.js and payment.php to include user_id
  - Payment-success page now handles both logged-in and non-logged-in scenarios gracefully
  - Users with valid user_id are automatically logged in, others redirected to login with return URL
- **Result**: Smooth payment flow without jarring redirects to login page after successful payment

## üì§ File Upload Configuration

The WordPress site is configured to handle large file uploads:

- **Upload Max Filesize:** 64MB
- **Post Max Size:** 64MB  
- **Memory Limit:** 512MB
- **Max Execution Time:** 300 seconds

These limits are configured in:
- `Dockerfile` - PHP configuration via `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini`
- `wp-content/themes/flexpress/functions.php` - WordPress-specific limits

To modify upload limits, update both the Dockerfile and rebuild the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## üí≥ Payment Integration

### Flowguard Payment System

FlexPress now uses **Flowguard** as the primary payment processing system, replacing Verotel FlexPay. Flowguard provides:

- **Embedded Payment Forms**: No redirects, seamless user experience
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Secure payment processing with hosted iframes
- **3D Secure Support**: Enhanced security for card transactions
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time payment notifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete payment management interface

#### Flowguard Configuration

1. **Access Settings**: Go to `FlexPress Settings ‚Üí Flowguard`
2. **Configure API**: Enter your Shop ID and Signature Key from ControlCenter
3. **Set Environment**: Choose between Sandbox (testing) or Production (live)
4. **Test Integration**: Use the built-in testing tools to verify setup

#### Payment Pages

- **Registration**: `/register-flowguard` - Cheeky user registration form
- **Join Page**: `/join-flowguard` - Modern membership signup with Flowguard integration
- **Payment Form**: `/flowguard-payment` - Embedded payment processing
- **Success Page**: `/payment-success` - Payment completion confirmation
- **Declined Page**: `/payment-declined` - Payment failure handling

#### Webhook Endpoint

Flowguard webhooks are automatically handled at:
```
/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=flowguard_webhook
```

#### Database Tables

The integration creates three database tables:
- `wp_flexpress_flowguard_webhooks` - Webhook event logging
- `wp_flexpress_flowguard_transactions` - Transaction records
- `wp_flexpress_flowguard_sessions` - Payment session tracking

### Discord Notifications System

```

**PPV Purchase:**
```
üé¨ PPV Purchase Approved
Member: Jane Smith
Amount: USD 9.95
Episode: "Hot Summer Nights"
Transaction ID: TXN_12345
```

#### Pro Tips

- **Separate Channels**: Create different Discord channels for different types of notifications
- **Role Mentions**: Use @mentions in webhook settings to ping specific team members
- **Regular Testing**: Test notifications regularly to ensure they're working properly
- **Team Coordination**: Set up role-based notifications for different team members

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues Fixed During Implementation:**

1. **API URL**: Use `https://flowguard.yoursafe.com/api/merchant` (not `api.yoursafe.com`)
2. **Minimum Amount**: Flowguard requires minimum $2.95 USD for transactions
3. **Minimum Period**: Subscriptions require minimum 2 days (`P2D`)
4. **Environment**: Sandbox and production use the same API URL
5. **Credentials**: Shop ID `134837` and Signature Key from ControlCenter

  - Updated button styles to automatically use appropriate text color based on accent color luminance
