## üí≥ Payment Integration

### Flowguard Payment System

FlexPress now uses **Flowguard** as the primary payment processing system, replacing Verotel FlexPay. Flowguard provides:

- **Embedded Payment Forms**: No redirects, seamless user experience
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Secure payment processing with hosted iframes
- **3D Secure Support**: Enhanced security for card transactions
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time payment notifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete payment management interface

#### Flowguard Configuration

1. **Access Settings**: Go to `FlexPress Settings ‚Üí Flowguard`
2. **Configure API**: Enter your Shop ID and Signature Key from ControlCenter
3. **Set Environment**: Choose between Sandbox (testing) or Production (live)
4. **Test Integration**: Use the built-in testing tools to verify setup

#### Payment Pages

- **Registration**: `/register-flowguard` - Cheeky user registration form
- **Join Page**: `/join-flowguard` - Modern membership signup with Flowguard integration
- **Payment Form**: `/flowguard-payment` - Embedded payment processing
- **Success Page**: `/payment-success` - Payment completion confirmation
- **Declined Page**: `/payment-declined` - Payment failure handling

#### Webhook Endpoint

Flowguard webhooks are automatically handled at:
```
/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=flowguard_webhook
```

#### Database Tables

The integration creates three database tables:
- `wp_flexpress_flowguard_webhooks` - Webhook event logging
- `wp_flexpress_flowguard_transactions` - Transaction records
- `wp_flexpress_flowguard_sessions` - Payment session tracking

### Discord Notifications System

#### Pro Tips

- **Separate Channels**: Create different Discord channels for different types of notifications
- **Role Mentions**: Use @mentions in webhook settings to ping specific team members
- **Regular Testing**: Test notifications regularly to ensure they're working properly
- **Team Coordination**: Set up role-based notifications for different team members

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues Fixed During Implementation:**

1. **API URL**: Use `https://flowguard.yoursafe.com/api/merchant` (not `api.yoursafe.com`)
2. **Minimum Amount**: Flowguard requires minimum $2.95 USD for transactions
3. **Minimum Period**: Subscriptions require minimum 2 days (`P2D`)
4. **Environment**: Sandbox and production use the same API URL
5. **Credentials**: Shop ID `134837` and Signature Key from ControlCenter
