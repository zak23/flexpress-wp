## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Newsletter Modal Turnstile Fix (September 2025)
- Resolved console error: `Uncaught TurnstileError: [Cloudflare Turnstile] Could not find widget.` when subscribing from the newsletter modal
- Changes:
  - Turnstile widget now uses required `cf-turnstile` class and fixed id `newsletter-turnstile`
  - Widget is explicitly rendered on modal open to ensure presence before token retrieval
  - JS targets the rendered widget id for `turnstile.getResponse(widgetId)` and `turnstile.reset(widgetId)`
  - Defensive guards added when `window.turnstile` is not yet ready
- Impact: Newsletter subscribe flow works reliably with Turnstile protection.

### Newsletter Modal Dismissal Persistence (September 2025)
- Added localStorage persistence to prevent the newsletter modal from reappearing after the user closes it
- Uses key `flexpress_newsletter_modal_dismissed` set to `true` on modal hide
- Auto-show is gated by this flag; users won’t be spammed with repeated prompts

### Admin Menu Consolidation (September 2025)
- Consolidated all settings under the single top-level menu: `FlexPress`
- Removed duplicate/standalone menus:
  - Turnstile: now only under `FlexPress → Turnstile`
  - Plunk: now only under `FlexPress → Plunk`
  - Flowguard: removed standalone top-level; now only `FlexPress → Flowguard`
  - Discord: removed standalone top-level; now only `FlexPress → Discord`
- Updated admin enqueue hooks to match correct page hooks (`flexpress-settings_page_*`)

New menu structure:

```

```

### Site URL Configuration (September 2025)
- **URL Standardization**: Standardized WordPress site URL to lowercase `https://zakspov.com` following best practices
- **Database Update**: Modified `wp_options` table to set both `siteurl` and `home` options to standardized URL
- **Documentation Update**: Updated README.md and .cursorrules to reflect correct URL structure
- **Configuration**: 
  - Live Site: `https://zakspov.com` (production site)
  - Test Site: `https://zakspov.com` (development data only)
- **Impact**: All WordPress-generated URLs now use the standardized lowercase domain structure

**Files Modified:**
- Database: `wp_options` table (`siteurl` and `home` options)
- `README.md` - Updated all URL references
- `.cursorrules` - Updated project configuration

### Age Verification Modal (September 2025)
- **SEO-Compliant Implementation**: Modal positioned in footer to avoid H3 interference with main content H1s
- **localStorage Persistence**: Users only see the modal once per browser session
- **Dynamic Styling**: Uses theme accent colors with automatic text color contrast
- **Accessibility Features**: Keyboard navigation support (ESC to exit, Enter to confirm)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layout with proper touch targets
- **Custom Logo Integration**: Automatically displays site logo or falls back to site title
- **Configurable Exit URL**: Admin can set custom exit URL in FlexPress Settings → General

- Users can reset verification status via browser console: `flexpressAgeVerification.reset()`
- Check verification status: `flexpressAgeVerification.status()`
- Configure exit URL in WordPress Admin → FlexPress Settings → General → "Age Verification Exit URL"

### Join Page Continue Button (September 2025)
- **Issue**: Continue button on join page was not responding to clicks
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript selector mismatch (`join-continue-btn` vs `membership-continue-btn`)
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed JavaScript selector to match button ID
  - Implemented registration functionality using existing `flexpress_process_registration_and_payment` AJAX handler
  - Implemented login functionality using existing `flexpress_ajax_login` AJAX handler
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Updated WordPress site URL to localhost:8085 for development testing (reverted back to zakspov.com for production)
- **Result**: Continue button now properly processes user registration/login and redirects to payment page

### Payment Success Login Flow (September 2025)
- **Issue**: Users redirected to `/payment-success/` after payment were not logged in, causing redirect to login page
- **Root Cause**: Payment-success page lacked login check and auto-login capability
- **Solution**: 
  - Added login check to payment-success page with auto-login for valid user_id parameters
  - Updated JavaScript redirects in flowguard.js and payment.php to include user_id
  - Payment-success page now handles both logged-in and non-logged-in scenarios gracefully
  - Users with valid user_id are automatically logged in, others redirected to login with return URL
- **Result**: Smooth payment flow without jarring redirects to login page after successful payment

### Enhanced 404 Page (January 2025)

To modify upload limits, update both the Dockerfile and rebuild the container:

### Cloudflare Turnstile Protection

FlexPress includes comprehensive Cloudflare Turnstile integration for advanced bot protection across all forms. Turnstile provides invisible bot protection without requiring users to solve CAPTCHAs, making it privacy-focused and GDPR compliant.

#### Turnstile Features

- **🛡️ Invisible Protection**: Most users won't see the widget unless suspicious activity is detected
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: No personal data is collected or stored
- **📱 GDPR Compliant**: No cookies or tracking required
- **📱 Mobile Friendly**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Minimal impact on page load times
- **🎨 Theme Integration**: Automatically matches your site's theme

#### Protected Forms

Turnstile protects the following form types:

- **📧 Contact Forms**: Contact Form 7, WPForms, and other contact form plugins
- **💬 Comment Forms**: WordPress native comment system
- **👤 Registration Forms**: User registration and signup forms
- **🔑 Login Forms**: User authentication and login forms

#### Turnstile Configuration

1. **Access Settings**: Go to `FlexPress Settings → Turnstile`
2. **Get Keys**: 
   - Visit [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → Turnstile → Add Site
   - Enter your domain and choose widget mode
   - Copy your Site Key and Secret Key
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Paste your Site Key and Secret Key
   - Choose widget theme (Auto/Light/Dark)
   - Select widget size (Normal/Compact)
   - Choose which forms to protect
4. **Test Connection**: Use the built-in test tool to verify your configuration

#### Turnstile Test Tool Behavior

- The admin Test Connection button hits Cloudflare's `siteverify` endpoint using your Secret Key. Because no user token is sent during a test, Cloudflare will typically respond with validation error codes (e.g., `missing-input-response`).
- This still confirms connectivity. The tool reports success when the API is reachable and returns a JSON response, even if validation errors are present due to the missing token.
- If the API cannot be reached (network/DNS/SSL issues), the tool reports an error with the underlying reason.

Troubleshooting:

- Ensure both Site Key and Secret Key are saved in `FlexPress Settings → Turnstile`.
- If you see a generic “undefined” message, refresh and try again. The tool now defaults to clear messages when `response.data` is missing.
- Check `wp-content/debug.log` for any “Turnstile validation error” entries when validating actual form submissions.

#### Widget Customization

**Theme Options:**
- **Auto**: Automatically matches your site's theme
- **Light**: Light theme for light backgrounds
- **Dark**: Dark theme for dark backgrounds

**Size Options:**
- **Normal**: Standard size widget
- **Compact**: Smaller, less intrusive widget

#### Form Protection Settings

You can enable/disable Turnstile protection for each form type:

- ✅ **Contact Forms**: Protect all contact forms (Contact Form 7, WPForms, etc.)
- ✅ **Comment Forms**: Protect WordPress comment forms
- ✅ **Registration Forms**: Protect user registration forms
- ✅ **Login Forms**: Protect user login forms

#### Technical Implementation

**Frontend Integration:**
- Automatically loads Cloudflare Turnstile script when enabled
- Adds Turnstile widget to protected forms
- Includes callback functions for token handling

**Server-Side Validation:**
- Validates Turnstile responses against Cloudflare API
- Prevents form submission if validation fails
- Logs validation errors for debugging

**Helper Functions:**
- `flexpress_is_turnstile_enabled()` - Check if Turnstile is configured
- `flexpress_should_protect_contact_forms()` - Check contact form protection

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Widget Not Appearing**: Check that Site Key is correctly entered
2. **Validation Failing**: Verify Secret Key is correct and matches Site Key
3. **Forms Not Protected**: Ensure the specific form type is enabled in settings
4. **Theme Issues**: Try switching between Auto/Light/Dark themes

**Debug Information:**

- `.upcoming-episode-section`: Main container
- `.hero-section`: Hero-style wrapper
- `.countdown-timer`: Countdown timer container
- `.countdown-unit`: Individual timer elements (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- `.hero-content-overlay`: Content overlay with gradient background

### Usage

#### Automatic Display
Simply **schedule an episode** in WordPress admin:
1. Create a new episode post
2. Set the **publish date** to a future date/time
3. Add **preview video** and **featured models** if desired
4. The upcoming episode will automatically appear on your homepage

#### Manual Display
You can also include the upcoming episode anywhere using the template part:

```php
<?php get_template_part('template-parts/upcoming-episode'); ?>
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Homepage**: Already included automatically
- **Episodes Page**: Add to `page-templates/episodes.php`
- **Custom Pages**: Include in any template
- **Sidebar Widget**: Create a custom widget
- **Shortcode**: Wrap in a shortcode function

**Example Usage:**
```php
// In any template file
<?php get_template_part('template-parts/upcoming-episode'); ?>

// In a custom widget
public function widget($args, $instance) {
    echo $args['before_widget'];
    get_template_part('template-parts/upcoming-episode');
    echo $args['after_widget'];
}

// In a shortcode
function upcoming_episode_shortcode($atts) {
    ob_start();
    get_template_part('template-parts/upcoming-episode');
    return ob_get_clean();
}
add_shortcode('upcoming_episode', 'upcoming_episode_shortcode');
```

### Styling Customization
The upcoming episode system uses CSS custom properties and can be customized by overriding the styles in your child theme or via the WordPress customizer.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Edit `.env` file to customize:
- Database credentials
- WordPress debug settings
- Port configurations

### WordPress Customization
- Themes: `wp-content/themes/`
- Plugins: `wp-content/plugins/`
- Uploads: `wp-content/uploads/`

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose up --build -d

# Access WordPress container
docker exec -it flexpress_wordpress bash

# Access MySQL container

```

## 🔧 WP-CLI Integration

FlexPress includes WP-CLI for powerful WordPress management directly from the command line.

### Using WP-CLI

```bash
# Use the convenient wrapper script
./wp-cli.sh [command]

# Examples:
./wp-cli.sh plugin list
./wp-cli.sh db export backup.sql
./wp-cli.sh user list
./wp-cli.sh theme status
./wp-cli.sh core version

# Or run directly in the container
docker exec -it flexpress_wordpress wp [command]
```

### Common WP-CLI Commands

```bash
# Plugin management
./wp-cli.sh plugin list
./wp-cli.sh plugin install contact-form-7
./wp-cli.sh plugin activate contact-form-7

# Database operations
./wp-cli.sh db export backup.sql
./wp-cli.sh db import backup.sql
./wp-cli.sh db search-replace 'old-domain.com' 'new-domain.com'

# User management
./wp-cli.sh user list
./wp-cli.sh user create admin admin@example.com --role=administrator

# Theme management
./wp-cli.sh theme list
./wp-cli.sh theme activate flexpress

# Core WordPress
./wp-cli.sh core version
./wp-cli.sh core update
./wp-cli.sh core download --force
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
- If port 8085 is occupied, change `SERVER_PORT` in `.env`
- Update docker-compose.yml ports mapping accordingly

### Database Issues
- Check container logs: `docker-compose logs db`
- Access phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8086
- Default credentials in `.env` file

### WordPress Issues
- Enable debug mode in `.env`: `WORDPRESS_DEBUG=1`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs wordpress`
- Access container: `docker exec -it flexpress_wordpress bash`

### Clearing debug.log
- Go to WordPress Admin → `FlexPress → Tools`
- Use the "Clear debug.log" button to truncate `wp-content/debug.log`
- The tool is nonce-protected and requires `manage_options` capability
- Shows current file size and last modified time before clearing

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Change default passwords before production
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable SSL/HTTPS in production
- Regular security updates required
- Keep WordPress core and plugins updated

## 📝 Development Guidelines

- Use IP addresses instead of localhost for server configuration
- Avoid port 3000 (reserved for MCP tools)
- All customizations in `wp-content/` directory
- Follow WordPress coding standards
- Test changes in development before production
