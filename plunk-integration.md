Store User Newsletter Status in User Profile
Show Status in my-account
Switch to change subscribed status

when someone signs up, add them to the newsletter (skip double opt in))

i want to track the users status based on their membership

eg
Metadata

Key: name
Value: sales

Key: signupDate
Value: 2024-12-03T05:28:15+00:00

Key: source
Value: Membership Registration

status: active|cancelled|expired

Subscribed: True

this way we can send emails to targeted groups
eg, sepcial discounts to expired members
