## Troubleshooting

   - Check notification toggles are enabled
   - Review WordPress debug logs

2. **Incomplete form data**
   - Ensure Contact Form 7 forms have proper field names
   - Check form field mapping in templates
   - Verify form submission is successful

3. **Wrong channel notifications**
   - Check webhook URL configuration
   - Verify channel type mapping
   - Test with different form types

### Debug Information
- **WordPress Debug Log:** Check `wp-content/debug.log` for Discord errors
- **Contact Form 7 Logs:** Check CF7 submission logs
- **Discord Webhook Logs:** Check Discord server audit logs

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Webhook Channels
You can set up different Discord channels for different notification types:

```php
// In Discord Settings
Default Webhook: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../general
Contact Forms Webhook: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../contact-forms
Financial Webhook: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../financial
```

### Custom Notification Content
The system uses different emojis and colors for each form type:
- **Contact:** üìß Blue (#0099ff)
- **Casting:** üåü Orange (#ff6b35)
- **Support:** üÜò Red (#ff0000)

### Role Mentions
You can configure Discord webhooks to mention specific roles:

- Use `@CastingTeam` for casting applications
- Configure `@AdminTeam` for form failures

## Security Considerations

- **Webhook URLs:** Keep Discord webhook URLs secure and private
- **Data Privacy:** Form data is sent to Discord - ensure compliance with privacy policies
- **Access Control:** Limit Discord channel access to authorized team members
- **Logging:** Monitor Discord audit logs for unauthorized access

## Future Enhancements
